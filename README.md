# cheatsheat
cheatsheet to use inside the terminal written in Python, which will only give you what you need, instead of the man pages.

## Why?
all over the internet there are different cheat sheets in websites and as printable pdf files, which are handy when learning or start using something you aren't familliar with. But these are all differently formatted, so the idea was to make my own printable cheat sheets, which all have the same format to use at my desk. But then i was thinking, why not iplement this inside the terminal, which is already open when i am behind my desk. This way you have them always nearby to lookup, but you can't lose them on your desk and they aren't laying in the way.
